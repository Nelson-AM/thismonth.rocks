When submitting an idea, consider these few points; 

- [ ] We prefer ideas that won't be a burden on a budget. Money is tight for a lot of folks. 
- [ ] We prefer ideas that are easy to pick up for most people. It helps if a tip is relevant for a crowd of people. Not a niche. 
- [ ] We prefer ideas that are specific. Cooking is great, but it's a large topic. Instead, "perfecting a pizza" would be better. 
- [ ] We prefer ideas that make it easier for people to practice social distancing. Content that helps with kids is *much* appreciated.
