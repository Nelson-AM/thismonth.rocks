If you're a fan of calvin and hobbes you can see 
their antics [online](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/07/27) or you
can [buy the whole collection](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781449433253).

Odds are that if you're from Europe that you're more into Asterix and Obelix.
You can get these digitally too over at [the official website](https://www.asterix.com/en/the-collection/albums/).

Then there's the DC and Marvel ones. These can be read on your [phone](https://www.marvel.com/mobile) these days.
