There are [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWAagS_MANg) ways to prepare an egg 
but the omelette remains a standard. 

<br>

Many [chefs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQyRuOEKfVk) have a variant and there's
different styles too. The [french variant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXPhVYpQLPA)
seems especially popular.

The maintainer of this project has especially fond memories of Delia Smith's cookbook
and it has a small chapter on how to [prepare eggs](https://www.eatyourbooks.com/library/12840/delias-how-to-cook-book). 
There's a video on [her omelette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ2uBYCVHik) as well now though.
